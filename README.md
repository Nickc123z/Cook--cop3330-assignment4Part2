We are making a Gui that controls user inputted data. The user may add, delete, edit, save and delete a to-do on the list.

-The to-do must have a description
-The to-do must have a date
-The user shall be able to add a new item to the list
-The user shall be able to remove an item from the list
-The user shall be able to clear the list of all items
-The user shall be able to edit the description of an item within the list
-The user shall be able to edit the due date of an item within the list
-The user shall be able to mark an item in the list as either complete or incomplete
-The user shall be able to display all of the existing items in the list
-The user shall be able to display only the incomplete items in the list
-The user shall be able to display only the completed items in the list
-The user shall be able to save the list (and all of its items) to external storage
-The user shall be able to load a list (and all of its items) from external storage


For my application, i have a main menu that displays add, remove, delete and more. if the user picks one of those options they will be taken to a second screen that will allow the user to input any string and a date and will save that data. If the user presses back, it will go back to the main menu.
